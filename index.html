            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>My name is Kaleb Stone, and I am a junior student at <a href="https://www.vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a> studying creative writing and <a href="https://www.vt.edu/academics/majors/professional-and-technical-writing.html">professional and technical writing</a>! I have worked as a freelance editor for more than four years now, having edited primarily essays and legal documents. Complementing my skills in writing, I have some basic experience in communications and marketing. I took multiple honors courses in high school, such as World Literature, Economics, and Government. I have also taken some notable college courses, such as Creating User Documentation and Writing and Digital Media. Furthermore, I have been on the Deanâ€™s List every semester I have taken thus far, and my current overall college GPA is 3.79. My interests and specialties are in writing and editing, but I have ensured that my skills are somewhat varied and widely applicable.</p>
