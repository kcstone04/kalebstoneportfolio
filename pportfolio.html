            <h2>Country Food and Furniture: Powhatan's Hidden Gem</h2>
            
            <p>
            I wrote this article for the website Richmond on the Cheap. The article advertises a restaurant from my local area that sells fantastic sandwiches, as well as well-made furniture. This was my first experience with journalism, so it was an excellent learning experience. I believe this article showcases my skills in formal and professional writing, as well as basic skills in journalism.

            <h2>Visual Rhetoric and Document Design Class Cookbook</h2>
            
            <p>
            This cookbook was designed in Adobe InDesign as the final project for the class Visual Rhetoric and Document Design. The recipes in the book were contributed by my classmates, with everyone in the class designing their own cookbooks including the same collection of recipes. I designed and compiled the cookbook myself, using icons from Icons8. This shows my ability to create well-written documents and professional books, as well as my ability to use Adobe InDesign.

            <p>
            I made this instructional video as part of the class Creating User Documentation. The video gives simple and easy-to-follow instructions on how to find, purchase, and download a game on Steam, which is a very popular platform and marketplace for computer video games. I scripted and recorded this video myself, showing off my ability to create and upload YouTube videos.

            <h2>Favorite Buildings on the Virginia Tech Campus</h2>
            
            <p>
            This is a project I made in Oxygen Content Fusion for the class Developing Intelligent Content. The assignment itself was to make an article of some kind that was somehow based on personal opinion, while also including some form of research. So I made this article about my personal favorite buildings on the Virginia Tech campus, and made sure to include some tangible research about the history of the buildings. This project shows my research skills, as well as my ability to use XML and Oxygen Content Fusion.

            <h2>Insanity of "The Mind Electric"</h2>
            
            <p>
           This short essay was written as the first project for First Year Writing taught by Dr. Nicholas Brown. The assignment was to analyze an ‘artifact’ of our choosing, so I chose the song “The Mind Electric” by Miracle Musical. Particularly, I analyzed how the song uses its sound to portray the protagonist going insane via electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This project was merely the precursor to a larger essay, which is displayed on the right.          </p>

            <h2>Circuitry of Fright - Is Public Opinion of ECT Justified?</h2>
            
            <p>
           This essay was built upon the short essay "Insanity of 'The Mind Electric'", and so was also for the same class. For this I expanded upon the previous project by researching electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to find out the real side-effects of the treatment. During my research I found out that the side-effects are rather minimal, and that the public image of ECT is overly negative. In this essay I argue why ECT should be more widely accepted because it can really help many people with several detrimental mental disorders.    </p>

            <h2>Worlds of Wonder: A Story of Digital Literacy</h2>
            
            <p>
            This essay was written for First-Year Writing: Intro to College Composition. The assignment asked us to tell the story of the development of our personal sense of digital literacy, and what the term meant to us. This was my favorite project from the class, mostly because it leveraged my skills in narrative writing over formal writing. Simultaneously, it helped highlight how much I need to work towards equalizing those skills, in order to feel more comfortable in professional writing settings. Despite those shortcomings, I do believe this well showcases my talents in narrative and creative writing.

            <h2>Cancer: An Unknowable Curse</h2>
            
            <p>
            This essay was written as my final project for Honors Biology, and I dedicated it to the YouTuber Technoblade who was suffering from cancer at the time of writing, and sadly passed away later. This was my last research paper I wrote in high school, and thus still displays some skill in scientific writing. This paper was also my first time ever writing in APA format, so it was a fresh and useful experience.

            <h2>College Application Essay</h2>
            
            <p>
            This essay was written for the common application for college, and was sent to Virginia Tech, The University of Iowa, and Mary Baldwin University. The prompt I decided to write for was to “Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome?” This essay got me accepted into all three colleges it was sent to, and I am still proud of it today.
