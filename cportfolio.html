            <h2>The Alien of the East Prologue</h2>
            
            <p>
            This was written for the class Intro to Creative Writing, and more importantly, is the prologue of a story I intend to develop further. The assignment for the class was simply to write a creative writing piece to be workshopped in the classroom. I knew I already wanted to write this, so it was easy to decide on what to do. While writing this, I focused on creative vivid imagery, alongside telling the story, which helped me practice writing prose at a higher level. I am very proud of this piece, as I believe it showcases my skills in writing powerful and evocative prose.

            <h2>The Rays of the Sun</h2>
            
            <p>
            This three-page short story was written in an online English club. It was written off of the prompt: “Your character heads to the beach and expects to have a fun day splashing in the waves. When they get there though, they find that the water is gone, or at least it’s not in sight.” I think this story displays skill in vague first-person storytelling, forming a narrative that is open to interpretation.

            <h2>Theory of Everything</h2>
            
            <p>
            This story was written in my senior year of high school. It represents original concepts for characters in a much larger story that I am still developing. This was my first time writing a story of this approximate length, and it was very interesting and challenging. Though I believe that my writing skills have improved since writing this, I am still quite proud of it, and I really appreciate it as a stepping stone for me on my journey to becoming a far better writer.

            <h2>White as Snow</h2>
            
            <p>
            This short story was written for the Studio 72 Fall 2023 Showcase. I tried to write in a fairytale style, so it was a little out of my comfort zone. This helps indicate my adaptation and ability to try new things when it comes to writing.

            <h2>Unhinged</h2>
            
            <p>
            This story was written in under fifteen minutes, with the starting prompt: “Only after the third attempt did he become unhinged.” Running off of that sentence, I crafted an absurd comedic story, which runs just over a page long. Obviously, since it was written so quickly, this does not properly reflect my regular writing skills, but I do believe this displays my skills when it comes to writing extremely quickly.

            <h2>2022 Poetry Anthology</h2>
            
            <p>
            This is a collection of poems I wrote for Honors Poetry in my senior year of high school. The assignment was to compile all of the poetry I wrote for the class into an anthology with a table of contents and a cover page. I don’t often write poetry, but I am proud of these pieces, and I believe they reflect my skill level when it comes to writing poetry.
