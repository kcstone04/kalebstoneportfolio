                I had always loved reading stories and coming up with my own in my head. It may sound cliché, but it’s true that I’ve always had one story or another brewing in the depths of my mind. That is how I got into the field of Creative Writing. My dream is to one day be a somewhat successful published author. I want my stories to be read and enjoyed my as many people as possible. On a more personal level, writing and thinking about my stories is entertaining and relaxing for me, so if I could one day do that professionally it would be incredible. I have already taken a few classes in Creative Writing, and have written a small portfolio’s worth of short stories that I am proud of. Currently, I am working on a much larger-scale story that I am aiming to get published in the coming years.

                On the flipside, Professional and Technical Writing (PTW) is my other major. I learned about PTW when I first visited Virginia Tech, and it sounded like a fantastic way to complement my other major, being Creative Writing. I needed a major that would get me more job opportunities, and PTW seemed like a perfect fit for me! I took basic HTML when I was in middle school, and I really enjoyed it, which makes the web design aspect of PTW a good fit. Furthermore, I have some freelance editing experience, including editing college essays and legal documents. Next summer, I will be looking for an internship in this field to gain more relevant work experience. I wish to improve my skills as much as possible before entering the workforce. I would also love to get a long-term job in this field out of college. A job in web design would be good, perhaps grant writing, or working at a publishing company as an editor. The last option would be especially great, as it is also heavily related to Creative Writing.
